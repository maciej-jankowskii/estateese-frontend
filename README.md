# Estateese

### This is my first application written after about six months of learning Java and Spring. I am currently creating the graphical interface using the React library. This is an application where I used my professional experience since I worked for about 2 years as a real estate agent. It is a simple CRUD application, secured with Spring Security. I used Liquibase to track changes in the database. The application allows users to register, log in to their accounts, register employees, add various types of properties, edit and delete them, and create offers based on them. I used basic HTTP requests such as POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE.
